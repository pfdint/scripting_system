# scripting_system

## scripting_system is a system for simplified script usage, written in bash.

### Using ss:

* You don’t have to remember the name, location, or options of any script that you write.
* You won’t need to change any of the code in your scripts to make them compatible with ss.
* You have a command line interface for viewing and using all of your scripts.
* You can back up all of your scripts to github because ss is freely distributable and modifiable.
* You can incorporate any script/utility/executable which can be executed from the command line normally, including perl and python scripts.
* You can group your scripts into categories entirely of your choosing.
* You can specify which options you wish to be prompted for, and customize those prompts.
* You can specify defaults for given options.
* You can specify dependencies for your script, files which must be present for it to execute.
* You can preset messages such as examples for the most common usages of your script.
* You can apply this to existing utilities which are complex, such as tar.
* You can manage scripts which are running in the background.
* You can invoke ss from the command line itself, as well as interactively.
* You can set safety warnings and double checks for dangerous scripts.
* You can use common functionality from ss in your own shell scripts, which takes the form of well made functions. Even if you want to move away from ss later, you can just copy the code from ss and paste it in your own script in place of the function call.
* You can automatically organize your scripts into directories by the categories you specified.

### Other points:
* ss is not for testing or debugging.
* ss is not for scheduling of scripts.
* do not apply to forehead.
